# qrCodeImageSorter

## Project Outline

This is a python module which is designed to assist in the easy taking and sorting of photos. 
It aims to solve a problem I have identified where a large number of photos need to be taken 
in a structured manner. While there are apps which aim to acheive this natively on device, 
these can sometimes make sharing of the task difficult. They are often also not as fast as 
the native camera apps, also sometimes missing some of the native post-processing on phones.

This tool will allow users to produce a simple list of QR codes that can be used as indices 
in the photos. The photos will then be split into folders based on the content of the QR 
codes.

## Instructions (TBC)

## Future Features

Currently the module is command line only. In future this will be expanded to include a GUI
which will simplify the generation of QR codes and the scanning of images for users.
